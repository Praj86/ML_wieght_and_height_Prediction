# Weight and Height Prediction

This project utilizes Machine Learning to predict an individual's weight and height. Two different algorithms, Linear Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), are implemented and compared for accuracy and performance.

# Overview
The objective of this project is to predict weight and height based on provided features. It compares the performance of two popular Machine Learning algorithms: Linear Regression and KNN.

# Data
The dataset used in this project includes features such as age, gender, and other relevant factors to predict weight and height. Ensure the dataset is available in the project directory as height.csv

# Modeling
# Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a fundamental and commonly used Machine Learning algorithm for regression tasks. It models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN is a simple, non-parametric, and instance-based learning algorithm. It classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified.
